															<h3>Hoag Orthopedics Research Institute</h3>
															<p>July, 2021 - February 2022</p>
														</header>
														<p> This internship is an extension of a senior design project done at UCI. 
															Once we were able to successfully determine that friction was able to decrease 
															the slipping between the surgical bone plate and the bone, we decided to continue 
															the project as interns where we primarily performed testing and analysis of the 
															textured plates that we designed. </p>
															<a class="image"><img style="border:1px solid black;" src="images/fixture.png" width="400" height="300" alt="" /></a>

															<a class="image"><img style="border:1px solid black;" src="images/fixture+boneplate.png" width="400" height="300"alt="" /></a>
														<p> Once of the problems that was encountered during the school year was that the 
															tensile testing machine would cause cracks in the bones; effectively destroying 
															the bone and damaging the plate. The first thing that we needed to do to continue
															the internship was to design a fixture that was able to support the bone as well as
															prevent slipping between the fixture and the tensile testing machine. I constructed a model in SolidWorks
															and performed Finite Element Analysis on the model to ensure that the fixture would not
															buckle under tensile stress. </p>

															<img style="border:1px solid black;" src="images/tensileclamp.png" width="200" height="300" alt="" />
														<p> After creating the fixture, the internship was able to continue, and we were able to start
															performing testing in the laboratory. We primarily only needed to perform tensile testing
															as the data we collected during the school year had a wide range of errors due to the initial 
															fixtures.

														<a class="image"><img style="border:1px solid black;" src="images/frictiontestingsketch.png" width="400" height="300" alt="" /></a>
														<p> As we were testing with the tensile machine, we also needed to find the coefficient of friction.
															The way we were able to achieve this goal was to utilize a pulley system and a series of weights. 
															A large weight was placed on plate which acted as our normal force in the friction equation. The pulley 
															would pull the plate along until the plates began to slowly move. This is when static friction stops,
															and kinetic friction begins and that is how we are able to determine the friction forces of our textured plates. 
															Both the tensile testing and the friction testing utilized 25 bone plates to achieve accurate results.

														<p> In this internship, I was able to learn the day-to-day manufacturing processes. 
															I learned how parts and prototypes were made and what the purpose of each tool was

												<h3>Tannery Wastewater Treatment System Thesis</h3>
												<p>October 2021 - Present</p>
											</header>
											<p> For my thesis, I worked on an off grid wastewater treatment system that would process effluent from the leather 
												tanning industries. I chose to work on this project as it seemed as though I thought that I can genuinely help people
												with the designed system. 
											</p>
											<a class="image"><img style="border:1px solid black;" src="images/mixingtank.png" width="300" height="300" alt="" /></a>
											<a class="image"><img style="border:1px solid black;" src="images/mixingansys.png" width="100" height="300" alt="" /></a>
											<p> After researching the most effective methods of wastewater treatment, I created CAD models of the parts used. The system is broken up
												into three difference stages. The primary stage is removal of the large particles in the water. Using a mixing tank and a sedimentation tank,
												suspended solids can be removed through coagulation and flocculation with the coagulant of choice being aluminum sulfate as it is cheap and effective. 
											</p>
											<a class="image"><img style="border:1px solid black;" src="images/photoreactor.png" width="300" height="300" alt="" /></a>
											<a class="image"><img style="border:1px solid black;" src="images/photoreactoransys.png" width="300" height="300" alt="" /></a>

											<p> The secondary component of the wastewater treatment system is a way to remove heavy metals from wastewater. This can be done through the concept of photoreduction. 
												The ion Chromium (VI) is the most toxic chemical in tannery wastewater and this method can reduce this ion into its less toxic state Chromium (III).
												Using titanium dioxide as a photocatalyst, the solar radiation of the sun can be harnessed to increase the rate at which the redox reaction happens. 
											</p>

											<a class="image"><img style="border:1px solid black;" src="images/gacansys.png" width="400" height="300" alt="" /></a>
											<p> The  tertiary stage in the system is the disinfection stage. The system utilizes an activated carbon filter to remove any microbes in the effluent as well as 
												adsorb any additional chromium that was not reduced in the previous stage.

													<h3>Autonomous Shopping Cart</h3>
													<p>March 2021 - June 2021</p>
												</header>
												<p> In this project, we were tasked to design a completely automatic vehicle
													that can move throughout a store and get products that a customer desired
													completely without human interaction. Our initial design involved having
													the customers close behind. Because of this fact, we decided to change
													the meaning of the word "autonomous." It did not make sense for the customers
													to follow close behind the cart, so instead they would still push the cart around
													to get to their destinations.
												</p>
												<a class="image"><img style="border:1px solid black;" src="images/racknpinion.png" width="400" height="300" alt="" /></a>
												<a class="image"><img style="border:1px solid black;" src="images/complete sketch.png" width="400" height="300" alt="" /></a>
												<a class="image"><img style="border:1px solid black;" src="images/navigation.png" width="400" height="300" alt="" /></a>
												<p> The project was split up into 5 different segments that would be the main design
													attributes to the system: steering, navigation, safety, anti-theft, and check-out. 
													Here you will see the series of sketches and our thought processes to achieve these 
													aspects of design. Ultimately, we agreed on the using a rack and pinion steering design,
													a triangulation tower method for our navigation, built in cameras for our safety, RF modules
													to prevent people from leaving with the carts and RF tags on each product for checkout. 
												</p>

												<a class="image"><img style="border:1px solid black;" src="images/camerasketch.png" width="100" height="200" alt="" /></a>
												<p> Once the design elements were decided on, the next step was to simulate the model in Robotic
													Operating System (ROS). With this program, we were able to compile a list of packages together
													and form a working virtual system of our shopping cart.

													<h3>Hoag Bone Plate Project</h3>
													<p>January 2021 - March 2021</p>
												</header>
												<p> The goal of this project was to determine if increasing friction between a surgical bone plate
													and the bone would effectively decrease the movement and slipping of the screws. A bone plate is used 
													a cast that is screwed directly to the bone for more serious injuries. 
												</p>
												<a class="image"><img style="border:1px solid black;" src="images/ridge.png" width="350" height="250" alt="" /></a>
												<a class="image"><img style="border:1px solid black;" src="images/tread.png" width="350" height="250" alt="" /></a>
												<a class="image"><img style="border:1px solid black;" src="images/pyramid.png" width="350" height="250" alt="" /></a>
												<p> In order to increase the friction, we thought the best and most cost-effective method of doing so was to add grooves
													or textures to the area that made contact with the bone. After conducting research, three different textures were ultimately
													decided on for their uniaxial friction coefficients.
												</p>
												<a class="image"><img style="border:1px solid black;" src="images/handle.jpg" width="400" height="300" alt="" /></a>
												<a class="image"><img style="border:1px solid black;" src="images/dynamic testing.jpg" width="400" height="300" alt="" /></a>
												<a class="image"><img style="border:1px solid black;" src="images/screwfea.jpg" width="400" height="300" alt="" /></a>
												<p> With the textures designed, all that was left was to perform both tensile and dynamic testing. To ensure that there were no 
													outside sources of error, we designed a single screw plate with an attachable handle to both the tensile and dynamic testing machine.
													We chose to make the single hole plate to prove the initial theory as well as determine the effectivity of a single screw rather than the 
													whole plate with six screws.

													<h3>Lifter Project</h3>
													<p>January 2021 - March 2021</p>
												</header>
												<p> The goal of this project was to design a system that allowed a weight to move from the floor up to three feet in the air and pushed
													onto a platform. We began working on preliminary sketches our designs; we needed a way to bring the weight up and a way to force the
													weight onto the platform.

												<a class="image"><img style="border:1px solid black;" src="images/lifterplatformsketch.png" width="400" height="300" alt="" /></a>
												<p> While most people would design a scissor lift for this particular application, we came at this problem with a larger emphasis on 
													creating the most cost-effective system that we could. So instead, we decided to utilize a series of pulleys to achieve our goals.
													The pulleys would pull a plate where the weights lied and a mechanical arm that would push the weight off the plate and onto the platform.

													<h3>Remote Control Car Project</h3>
													<p>September 2020 - December 2020</p>
												</header>
												<p> For this project, we were tasked to create a physical model of a bot that would move based on an arduino remote control. 
													The two main aspects of the project were the CAD modeling and the Arduino programming for the remote control. 
												</p>
												<a class="image"><img style="border:1px solid black;" src="images/robotpropulsion.png" width="400" height="300" alt="" /></a>
												<a class="image"><img style="border:1px solid black;" src="images/robotsteering.png" width="400" height="300" alt="" /></a>
												<p> For the CAD model design, I created a chassis that would theoretically hold all the electronics and the Arduino. 
													In addition to this, a steering system needed to be designed and I chose to go with the Crank Shaft steering system.
													The propulsion system is utilizing an air piston connected to a one way bearing to ensure that the bot would only move forward.
